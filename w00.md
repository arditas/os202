Top 10 LIST this week

1. computer system can be divided into 4 components: hardware, operating system, application programs, users
2. operating system is a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of hardware and managing execution of user programs
3. computer system operation - one or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory
4. Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines. an operating system is interrupt driven
5. storage structure: main memory, secondary storage, hard disk drives (HDD), non-volatile memory (NVM)
6. storage ystems organized in hierarchy: speed, cost, volatility.
7. caching: â€“ copying information into faster storage system; main memory can be viewed as a cache for secondary storage
8. multiprocessors (parallel system, tightly-coupled system): asymmetric multiprocessing (performs specific task), symmetric multiprocessing (performs all tasks)
9. dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other components: user mode and kernel mode
10. A process is a program in execution. It is a unit of work within the system. Program is a passive entity, process is an active entity.
Process needs resources to accomplish its task: CPU, memory, I/O, files, Initialization data
